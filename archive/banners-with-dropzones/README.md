# Banners with drop-zones

Original creator: Mikey Binns
Original project: CloudCall

This is a two block combination of the info banner block, which was used to display a banner, and a dropzone, where the banner would be moved to.

It was deemed to be too complex for clients to interact with, but a competent or trained individual may get more flexibility around placement and styling out of this technique than the central admin page method.

The banner Ids are not complete, currently they are just text inputs with no validation.
Banner dismissal is not linked with a cookie, so dismissals are only valid until the page is refreshed.
