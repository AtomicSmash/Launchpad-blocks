# Breakout Media and Text spec

This is the block spec for this block. Any updates to the block must make sure they follow the spec defined here.
Adding or removing content from this spec should be considered a BREAKING_CHANGE

1. The block must work for all types of users, including but not limited to sighted users, screen-reader users, keyboard users, mouse users, and users on different screen sizes.
2. The admin side design must match the front end design as closely as possible. Any settings for the block not related to its content should be added in the sidebar, not the main content area.
3. The user should be able to choose which side of the block the media is shown on.
4. The media should be stacked with the content on mobile. Whichever is on the left on desktop should come first on mobile.
5. The content area should allow developers to add whatever content they wish when extending the block.
6. The content area should be limited to fixed content for end users.
7. The user should be able to toggle the image to break out of the container alignment.
8. The user should be able to toggle on/off a predefined background colour.
