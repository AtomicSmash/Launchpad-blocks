# Tabs block spec

This is the block spec for this block. Any updates to the block must make sure they follow the spec defined here.
Adding or removing content from this spec should be considered a BREAKING_CHANGE

1. The block must work for all types of users, including but not limited to sighted users, screen-reader users, keyboard users, mouse users, and users on different screen sizes.
2. The admin side design must match the front end design as closely as possible. Any settings for the block not related to its content should be added in the sidebar, not the main content area.
